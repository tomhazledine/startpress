##Install

Download repo and run the following from the directory:

```js
npm install

gulp
```

That should download all required dependencies and get you up and running!

##Usage

All work should be done inside the `uncompressed`folder. Everything inside this folder will be compressed/optimised and placed into the corresponding `assets` folder.

There are also a few standalone commands that can be run:

`gulp jslint`: This will run your javascript in the `js/custom` folder through a JS linter.
