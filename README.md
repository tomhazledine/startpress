# Startpress
v.1.2.1

## Overview

This is my personal 'boilerplate' Wordpress theme to speed up development. I update it regularly, as nearly every project I use it on triggers some changes and updates.

##Install

Download repo into your Wordpress theme directory.

Move "__plugins" content into Wordpress' plugins directory.

Run `npm install` to set-up the Gulp environment.

## Usage

Run `gulp` to activate the Gulp task.

There are also a few standalone commands that can be run:

`gulp jslint` will run all javascript in the "js/custom" folder through a JS linter.
